# Ghoomakkad Library Project

[Ghoomakkad](http://ghoomakad.com/ "A Continuous traveller") is the first host space for the [Infinity Hackerspace](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/infinity). A place for self exploration, learning about community living, technology, farming and lots of other things from the community. [Dharmshala](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiAwfrO64rTAhXBLo8KHZFsA38QFggeMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDharamsala&usg=AFQjCNHB8Zu9jw8xptk-9HF3drDNMT29fA&sig2=F7fjn-IsgjMgNYmRD1q-kg) is having a vibrant community of people from Tech, Art, Music & Culture. This is the place where you will meet lots of awesome people from around the world.


I was resident of this place from April 2016 to Nov 2016. I had wonderful experience. It was full of learning, Yoga, Tech and community living.


Lots of traveller leave some awesome books in hackerspace. So one day we (Me, Shan and Akshay) thought of organizing all the books. We started with dusting books, putting them in racks, and thought of making a list of all the books somewhere online.


Shan gave an idea to scan the barcodes available in most of the books (Lots of local books were not having ISBN). After a little bit of research we got the Goodreads in iTunes. Goodreads app have a feature to scan ISBN barcodes and add them into a named library. Later on which can be exported as a CSV datafile.


So ghoomakkad library is listing of all the books available there in Infinity Hackerspace.
